(Option 1) Columbia Basin/lower Snake River Sub-basin/Lahontan Basin  (Is Northwest Lakes Basin an intermediary???)
Ca. columbianus -> Ca. tahoensis
Ca. shoshonensis -> Wall Canyon Group -> Owens Basin via Lahontan Basin
P. bondi -> P. lahontan (No extant Northwest Lakes relatives)


(Option 2) Bonneville Basin/upper Snake River Sub-basin/Green River Basin 
C. macrocheilus is distributed in the upper Snake -> Common Ancestor into Bonneville. Diversification into two morphotypes (Ch. liorus, Ca. ardens)

P. platyrhynchus (same species across divide?)
	Bonneville, upper Snake and Green River basins (Fremont of Green River is different)
	
P. virescens (same species across divide)
   	northern Bonneville and upper Snake River basins

(Option 3) Colorado -> Virgin-White
P. clarkii
